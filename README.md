## ðŸŒŸ About The Project

This project provides the planning and design documentation for a Content Management System. It is intended to serve as a blueprint for development, detailing the system's architecture and functionalities from a user-centric perspective. The documentation is based on Use Case diagrams for different user roles and a relational database schema (ER Diagram).

## âœ¨ Key Features

The CMS is designed with the following core functionalities:

* **User Management:** Secure registration, login, and profile management for all user roles.
* **Role-Based Access Control:** Distinct privileges for Admins, Staff, and Owners.
* **Page Management:** Admins can create and manage all pages. Owners can manage their own dedicated pages.
* **Content Request Workflow:** Owners can request page creation, which Admins can approve or deny.
* **Staff Delegation:** Admins can create staff accounts and delegate page management tasks.
* **Reporting:** A dashboard for viewing system metrics and generating reports.

## ðŸ‘¥ User Roles

The system defines three primary user roles, each with specific capabilities:

1.  **Owner:** The primary client or user who owns a specific page. They can manage their page's content and view reports related to their page.
2.  **Admin:** A superuser with full control over the system. The Admin manages all pages, users (Staff and Owners), and system-wide settings.
3.  **Staff:** A user role created by an Admin to assist with content management tasks. Their permissions are assigned and managed by the Admin.

## ðŸ“š System Documentation

This repository houses all relevant design and planning documents for the CMS.

* **User Stories (`User_Story_*.md`):** A comprehensive list of user stories categorized using the MoSCoW prioritization method (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have). This document drives the development priorities.
* **Use Case Diagrams:** Visual representations of the interactions between users and the system.
* **ER Diagram:** The entity-relationship diagram detailing the database schema, including tables, columns, and relationships.
